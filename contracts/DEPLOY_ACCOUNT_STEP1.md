## Step 1: Get Sepolia ETH

You need Sepolia ETH to pay for account deployment (~0.001-0.01 ETH).

### Faucets to get Sepolia ETH:
1. **Starknet Faucet**: https://faucet.starknet.io/
2. **Starknet Sepolia Faucet**: https://starknet-faucet.vercel.app/
3. **Other faucets**: Search "Starknet Sepolia faucet"

### Important:
You can send ETH to your account address **before** it's deployed. The address exists (it's derived from your private key), you just need to deploy the account contract.

## Step 2: Check Account Balance

Once you have ETH, we'll check the balance, then deploy.

## Step 3: Deploy Account

Then we'll deploy your account to Sepolia.

## Step 4: Deploy Contract

Once account is deployed, we can deploy your Counter contract!

**Next**: Get Sepolia ETH first, then come back and we'll deploy the account.
